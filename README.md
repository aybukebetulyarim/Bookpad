Java Spring Boot and Spring Security are utilized for authentication and authorization operations with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The implementation also incorporates a Refresh Token mechanism. Database operations are managed through JPA Repository with MySQL, and a role mechanism is applied such as User and Admin. To enhance error handling, a custom exception class is employed. REST best practices are adhered to, including the creation of a BaseResponse to ensure proper responses. The project is structured within Docker containers, and the use of MapStruct prevents entities from being returned as responses.
